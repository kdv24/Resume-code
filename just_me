    <h1>Profile</h1>
       <p>I moved to Portland in July 2012 with my husband, two sons, and our black pug.  I'm quick to laugh, analytical, and have a constant vision towards improving, always seeing opportunities.  I work well with others, but also like working alone.  Shiny technology makes me happy.  And, I always put two spaces after a period.</p>
